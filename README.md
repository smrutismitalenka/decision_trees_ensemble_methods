## Title
### Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods
Regression and Classification problems are analyzed in this assignment.
The market historical [data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Real+estate+valuation+data+set) of real estate valuation from Sindian Dist., New Taipei City, Taiwan are collected  for regression problem.
For classifcation probelm, the heart desease [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) of the Cleveland is used.
Decision tree models and hyperparameter regularization are done for both regression and classifaction. Various ensmeble methods are analyzed and the average accuracy from all the models is calculated.
